As of today, June 13, 2016, I’m officially deprecating EZAudio. I’d like to thank everyone for the support over the last few years I’ve been hacking on EZAudio and working to make it better.

## Alternatives

Aure (of [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/)) and Michael (of [The Amazing Audio Engine 2](https://github.com/TheAmazingAudioEngine/TheAmazingAudioEngine2)) are continuing to make huge strides in their respective frameworks. They actively maintain these projects and can better answer your audio related queries. Here are their repos:

- [AudioKit](https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit)
- [The Amazing Audio Engine 2](https://github.com/TheAmazingAudioEngine/TheAmazingAudioEngine2)
- [AVAudioEngine](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioEngine_Class/)

## Why?

EZAudio started as a pet project of mine in 2013 in an attempt to reduce the amount of duplicate code I was writing for my own iOS/Mac audio projects. I originally just wanted to record audio from an iPhone’s mic and plot a waveform. This over time quickly grew into the collection of classes you may know today (EZMicrophone, EZAudioPlot, etc). 

I apologize for not being more active in addressing the issues and pull requests, but I’m hoping you all understand I’m only one person. EZAudio was solely written and maintained by me out of love during weeks of time I wasn’t making any money, all while living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. Like many of you, I spend the majority of my time working full-time to sustain myself (I have bills and rent to pay too!). I’m transitioning to non-audio ventures and will hopefully be able to share another cool open source project soon enough. 

Getting the opportunity to work on EZAudio with all of you has been an incredibly insightful experience and I’m incredibly grateful to have gotten a chance to share it with all of you. Thank you.

## Is all of it broken?

As I’m writing this I’m a little hesitant to say it’s all broken (despite all the issues filed), but I’d recommend forking this repo from this point forward and using at your own risk. I’ll probably be continuing to use EZAudio’s EZAudioPlot for rendering waveforms in my future projects, however, please don’t expect any updates to this repo. Deprecated means I won’t be responding to issues, EZAudio-related emails, or pushing any new changes to this repo.
